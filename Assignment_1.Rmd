## 1 Calculate the probability
**Base the information in the assignment, this is a possion distribution called M. And the lambda is 2, k is the misprints in a page ranging from 0 to 10. Therefore the probability that k misprints occur is $P(M > k) = 1 - P(M \leq k) =$ 1 - ppois($k$, lambda = 2). The following table shows the p.d.f of M as dprob, the C.D.F of M as cprob and the probability of $P(M > k)$ as tailprob.**


```{r}
k = 0
result1 = matrix(character(), nrow = 0, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
for (k in 0:10){
  dprob = dpois(k, lambda = 2)
  cprob = ppois(k, lambda = 2)
  tailprob = 1 - ppois(k, lambda = 2)
  result1 = rbind(result1, c(k, dprob, cprob, tailprob))
  next
}
colnames(result1) <- c("k","prob","cprob","tailprob")
print(result1)
```

## 2 The full table of n x k
**First, we should caculate the probability that among 50 pages n pages have the k misprints. The probability is $P(T \leq n) =$ pbinom($n$, 50, $P_k$).**

```{r}
k = 10
n = 50
result2 = matrix(character(), nrow = 10, ncol = 50)
for (n in 1:50){
  for (k in 1:10){
    result2[k,n] = pbinom(n ,50, 1 - ppois(k, lambda = 2))
    next
  }
}
print(result2)
```
